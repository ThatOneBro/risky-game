# A Risky game

A simple Risk-inspired player-vs-player game in Typescript

Hosted game: https://risky-game.pages.dev

__TODO: write a better README__

## TODO
- [ ] Make clicking on a tile select it
- [ ] While having your own tile selected, clicking on a nearby tile should move all but one troops to that tile
- [ ] If moving into a tile that is occupied, add or subtract troops if own tile or enemy tile
- [ ] Add battle resolution mechanics (chance + modifiers)
- [ ] Add turn system

## Way later
- [ ] Add map modifiers (entrenchment? penalty on attacker when crossing a river, going into mountains, etc.) 
- [ ] Object pools to prevent excessive GC
